# CGseq2pdbchain Feature

In this readme file, we start from the amino acid sequences to
* generate atomistic structures (in PDB or XYZ) format using the default seq2pdbchain
* then, generate coarse-grained configuration in PDB or XYZ where the CG mapping is performed to leave out only the carbon-alpha atoms from each amino acid
* here we provide a paradigmatic example with FUS protein
